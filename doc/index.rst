**SpiffWorkflow is a library that provides a flexible workflow execution environment.**

SpiffWorkflow is the workflow library underlying `Spiff Arena <https://github.com/sartography/spiff-arena>`_.

It consists of a generic core library, with packages supporting parsing and execution of BPMN diagrams that extend
this core.

Extensive documentation about BPMN and how SpiffWorkflow interprets it, as well as information about custom extensions
implemented in the :code:`spiff` package can be found in the
`Spiff Arena documentation <https://spiff-arena.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. If you are not familiar with BPMN, you
should start there. If you are looking for a full-fledged BPMN application, you can start and end there. This
documentation will focus on the library itself and is geared towards developers who are building their own
applications.

Please visit `SpiffWorkflow.org <https://www.spiffworkflow.org>`_ for
additional articles, videos, and tutorials about SpiffWorkflow and its
related projects including SpiffArena, Service Connectors, and BPMN.js
extensions.
